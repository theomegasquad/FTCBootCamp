# FTCBootCamp

Thank you everyone for participating in this year's FTC Bootcamp. I hope you learned a lot, as we 
covered a variety of different topics in a short span of time, and I'm very proud of the growth that
all of the students displayed. Just to go over what we learned:

1. Structural Components
2. REV Hub connection w/ Driver Station
3. Sensors and motors (Servos vs DC)
4. Android Studio & Java
5. Configuration
6. Autonomous programming
7. Tele-ops programming
8. Sensor input (touch sensor)
9. Computer Aided Design w/ Onshape

Its amazing that we were able to cover so many topics in only 5 days! All of the students have real
potential for learning more advanced robotics in the future!

This repository serves two purposes. Firstly, it stores the you or your students code. All students 
worked in pairs, so the folders are titled with the partner pair's names. You can look at all the
individual programs that you made for future reference. Additionally, for further resources on more
advanced robotics & FTC topics, such as color sensors, the IMU, and servo control, look at the folder 
titled TeamCode, which will have lots of good sample programs on those topics.

Finally, here is a short video outlining everything we learned over this week. It contains clips of the
robot running and the students working, so feel free to give it a watch!

 Once again, thank you everone for attending the camp. I hope you had fun and learned a lot!
